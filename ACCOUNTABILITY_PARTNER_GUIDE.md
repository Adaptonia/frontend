## 🔍 **Why You're Not Seeing Other Users**

### **Current Situation:**
You likely have only 1-2 test accounts, so:
- ❌ Not enough users in the system yet
- ❌ No other users with similar preferences
- ⚠️ May have matched with yourself (if testing)

### **What Actually Shows in "Search Partners":**

The partner search shows:
1. **Available Users** - Have preferences set, not matched yet
2. **Compatibility Score** - How well you match (0-100%)
3. **Shared Interests** - Common categories
4. **Time Overlap** - If your schedules align

**Example Display:**
```
👤 John Doe
   Compatibility: 85%
   Categories: Finance, Career
   Available: Evenings
   [Request Partnership]
```

---

## 🎭 **Testing With Multiple Accounts**

### **Current Issue:**

1. Set preferences
2. Create a goal
3. Break into tasks
4. Mark a task as done
5. Request verification

#### **Account 2 (Test Partner):**
1. Login to second account
2. Go to Partnership Dashboard
3. See verification request
4. Approve/reject the task
