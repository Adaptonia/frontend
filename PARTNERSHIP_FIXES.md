# Partnership System - Bug Fixes Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Partner Preferences Not Persisting**
**Problem:** User preferences were being saved but disappearing after page reload.

**Root Cause:** The `userId` field was initialized as empty string when the form loaded before the user object was available.

**Fix:**
- Modified `PartnerPreferencesForm.tsx` to ensure `userId` is always set from `user.id` before saving
- Added `dataToSave` object that includes the correct userId

**Files Changed:**
- `/components/partnership/PartnerPreferencesForm.tsx` (line 147-150)

---

### 2. **User Document Lookup Using Wrong ID**
**Problem:** Multiple 404 errors when trying to fetch user documents.

**Root Cause:** Code was using `userId` (auth ID) as the document ID, but users are stored with `ID.unique()` as document ID and `userId` as a field.

**Fix:**
- Changed all user lookups from `getDocument(userId)` to `listDocuments` with `Query.equal('userId', userId)`
- Fixed in 3 locations:
  1. `userService.ts` - `ensureUserFields()`
  2. `userService.ts` - `updateUserLoginActivity()`
  3. `partnerNotificationService.ts` - `getUserById()`

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/appwrite/userService.ts` (lines 361-428, 431-458)
- `/services/partnerNotificationService.ts` (lines 137-157)

---

### 3. **Invalid Document Structure Error**
**Problem:** 400 error when trying to update user with `lastLoginAt`, `loginCount`, and `isActive` fields.

**Root Cause:** These fields don't exist in the Appwrite users collection schema.

**Fix:**
- Modified `updateUserLoginActivity()` to only update fields that exist in the schema
- Added conditional checks before attempting to update each field
- Made the function fail gracefully if fields don't exist

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/appwrite/userService.ts` (lines 387-403)

---

### 4. **Document Already Exists Error**
**Problem:** 409 error when trying to create preferences for a user who already has them.

**Root Cause:** Form was trying to create new preferences instead of updating existing ones.

**Fix:**
- Modified `createPartnerPreferences()` to check if preferences exist first
- If preferences exist, update them instead of creating new ones

**Files Changed:**
- `/services/appwrite/partnershipService.ts` (lines 56-105)

## üîß Technical Details

### Query Pattern Change
**Before:**
```typescript
const user = await databases.getDocument(
  DATABASE_ID,
  USERS_COLLECTION_ID,
  userId  // ‚ùå Wrong - uses userId as document ID
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { Query } = await import('appwrite');
const result = await databases.listDocuments(
  DATABASE_ID,
  USERS_COLLECTION_ID,
  [Query.equal('userId', userId)]  // ‚úÖ Correct - queries by userId field
);
const user = result.documents[0];
```

### User Document Structure
```
Document ID: "68d6ddf1002596b99239" (random ID from ID.unique())
Fields:
  - userId: "68dbbdd00021044329ed" (Appwrite auth user ID)
  - email: "user@example.com"
  - name: "John Doe"
  - role: "user"
  - ...other fields
```

## üìù Notes

- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- Error handling is graceful - failures don't block user flow
- Email sending is non-blocking - won't fail if Resend API is down
- Login activity tracking skips gracefully if fields don't exist in schema

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_PJfanq2a_E1jm2GZeVRbXq1cY8ot5xh2P
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=682b1633003712630789
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=682b16d40036fd19f920
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID=682b16e7003b6a8eba84
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PARTNERSHIP_PREFERENCES_COLLECTION_ID=68d6dde400022c1f2eab
```

### Appwrite Collection Requirements
- **users**: Must have `userId` field indexed for queries
- **partnership_preferences**: Must have `userId` field indexed for queries
- Both collections need proper read/write permissions for authenticated users
